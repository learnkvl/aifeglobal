mkdir aifeglobal
cd aifeglobal

2. Create a Virtual Environment
A virtual environment helps isolate dependencies:

python -m venv env

 3. Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows:

env\Scripts\activate

 4. Install Required Libraries
If you're starting from scratch:


pip install Django

If you've cloned the project:


pip install -r requirements.txt

Install other required libraries like:


pip install djangorestframework django-cors-headers

 5. Start a New Django Project (if needed)

django-admin startproject backend .

 6. Configure settings.py
In backend/settings.py:

Add your apps to INSTALLED_APPS
